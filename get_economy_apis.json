"title": "BoE holds rates to wait for further data, while ECB proceeds with first rate cut since 2019",
"description": "The Bank of England (BoE) kept rates on hold at 5.25% as expected, with few changes to its statement and no press conference due to election campaign restrictions. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) vote remained unchanged, with seven members voting to keep rates on hold and two members voting for a 25-basis-point cut. However, the decision was described as "finely balanced" for some policymakers, suggesting potential support for a rate cut in August.",

"content": "Bank of England The BoE’s decision aligned with market expectations, following recent stronger-than-expected wage growth and persistent high service sector inflation. Although there were no major changes, the market perceived the decision as slightly dovish, leading to a 0.20% weakening of the GBP and a dip in U.K. government bond yields. Subtle hints suggest an August rate cut is possible, with just three MPC members needed to switch from a finely balanced on-hold decision, to voting in favour of a rate cut. In addition, the statement suggested less concern over the persistence of services inflation, which slowed only to 5.70% last month from 5.90% in April, "The upside news in services price inflation relative to the May report did not alter significantly the disinflationary trajectory that the economy was on.”Furthermore, the Bank’s surveys of consumer inflation expectations and company wage growth expectations both fell this month, suggesting these forward-looking components are supportive of further cooling in price pressures, requiring a less restrictive stance."

With the Swiss National Bank announcing their first rate cute, various central banks find themselves at different points along the spectrum of monetary policy adjustments. As the Bank of England (BoE) is nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle and hinting at a potential rate cut post-summer, the Fed dot plot projections suggest three 25-basis-point cuts for the U.S., with the first expected during the June meeting. In contrast, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the BoE grapple with sluggish growth dynamics, placing increased pressure to stimulate economic activity."

The interview with Euromoney explored drivers beyond interest rates that are resulting in an increased interest in deal-contingent hedging, such as currencies trading at historic levels, an inverted yield curve, and the volatility in commodity pricing."

The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates this month, the first in nearly five years and the second of the Group of 10 (G10) central banks, after Canada’s rate cuts the day before. The ECB lowered its main refinancing rate to 4.25% and the deposit rate to 3.75%. As the Central Bank seeks to prevent markets from pricing in cuts that could fuel inflation, ECB President Lagarde stated that if inflation continues to decline, there may be further rate cuts."
